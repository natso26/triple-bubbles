# triple-bubbles

Code for solving the 1D triple bubble problem with log-convex density.

## Animation
The animation for density f_1 is [triple.mp4](triple.mp4). The animation for density f_2 is [triple2.mp4](triple2.mp4).

## Code
The files [Triple Bubble.ipynb](Triple%20Bubble.ipynb) and [Triple Bubble 2.ipynb](Triple%20Bubble%202.ipynb), respectively, generate these animations.
These are written in Julia. To run them, you can copy and paste them into http://juliabox.com.
