# triple-bubbles

Code for solving the 1D triple bubble problem with log-convex density.

## Animation
The animation for density f_1 is [triple.mp4](https://github.com/natso26/triple-bubbles/raw/master/triple.mp4). The animation for density f_2 is [triple2.mp4](https://github.com/natso26/triple-bubbles/raw/master/triple2.mp4).

## Code
The files [Triple Bubble.ipynb](Triple%20Bubble.ipynb) and [Triple Bubble 2.ipynb](Triple%20Bubble%202.ipynb), respectively, generate these animations.
These are written in Julia. To run them, you can follow these instructions.

1. Download the files [Triple Bubble.ipynb](https://github.com/natso26/triple-bubbles/raw/master/Triple%20Bubble.ipynb) and [Triple Bubble 2.ipynb](https://github.com/natso26/triple-bubbles/raw/master/Triple%20Bubble%202.ipynb) to your computer. (These links point to the files; you can right click and download on most browsers.)

2. Log in to https://www.juliabox.com using either GitHub, Google, or LinkedIn.

3. Upload the code files to JuliaBox. To do this, click the `Upload` button on the topright corner.
The files will then appear in your JuliaBox.

4. You can now run the files. To do so, click on the file. You will be directed to a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Clicking `Run` on the toolbar above will run the current cell. You can run the cells manually in order, or run all cells at once by clicking the fast forward icon. (Keep in mind that these interfaces may change in the future.)
